# Two datasets on four engines — one dbt project, switch the profile

An **educational** dbt project that runs the *same* pipeline on **four execution engines**.
You pick the engine by switching the dbt **target** — the model DAG, the `ref()` graph, and
the tests are identical no matter which one you run.

There are **two datasets**, chosen with the `DATASET` env var (`aemo` | `nyc`, default
`aemo`), and they are a pair rather than a menu:

| | `aemo` | `nyc` |
|---|---|---|
| what | Australian electricity market (AEMO NEM) | NYC TLC yellow-taxi trips |
| in | ragged CSV from nemweb | monthly parquet from TLC's CDN |
| out | `mart.fct_summary` — 143M rows, **5 narrow columns**, regular 5-min x DUID grid | `mart.fct_trips` — ~1.5B rows, **17 columns** |
| shape | near-uniform | four categoricals at 97-99% one value, two Zipfian zone ids |

The pairing is the point, and it has already earned itself. What Fabric's V-Order is worth
depends on the **surface** — column count times categorical skew — not on row count. Measured
on `fct_summary` it appeared to do no row reordering at all; measured on `fct_trips`, same code
and same instrument, it reorders the most repetitive column by **3,371x**. One dataset would
have given the wrong answer with a straight face.

```bash
dbt build --target duckrun  # DuckDB executes, delta-rs writes Delta Lake   (default; runs offline)
dbt build --target iceberg  # DuckDB + Iceberg REST catalog on OneLake
dbt build --target dwh      # Fabric Warehouse, pure T-SQL
dbt build --target spark    # Fabric Spark (Livy), writes Delta
```

## The one idea

Two of the engines speak the **same SQL dialect** (DuckDB), so they share one copy of every
model — switching between `duckrun` and `iceberg` really is *just* a profile change. The other
two have their **own SQL dialects** (Fabric Warehouse T-SQL, Spark SQL), so they are honest
*ports* of the same logic. That spectrum — identical code → dialect port — is the whole lesson.

```
                       ┌── duckrun  ─┐
   models/<ds>/duckdb/ ┤             │  same DuckDB SQL, two engines
                       └── iceberg  ─┘
   models/<ds>/dwh/  ──── dwh          T-SQL port (OPENROWSET, TRY_CAST, [brackets])
   models/<ds>/spark/ ─── spark        Spark SQL port (path datasource, MERGE)
```

## How one project serves four engines

- **One profile, four outputs** (`profiles.yml`). `--target` selects the engine.
- **Three dialect folders** under `models/`, gated in `dbt_project.yml` so **exactly one is
  enabled** per target (on `target.type`). Because the model *names* are identical across
  folders, `ref()`, downstream models, and tests don't care which engine is live.

  | target | `type` | enabled folder |
  |---|---|---|
  | `duckrun` | `duckrun` | `models/<dataset>/duckdb` |
  | `iceberg` | `duckdb` | `models/<dataset>/duckdb` |
  | `dwh` | `fabric` | `models/<dataset>/dwh` |
  | `spark` | `fabricspark` | `models/<dataset>/spark` |

  > The dataset is the OTHER axis of the same gate. Both conditions live in ONE `+enabled` on the
  > dialect key — `+enabled` is a scalar, so splitting them across nesting levels silently builds
  > the wrong dataset. `python .github/scripts/check_gating.py` runs the whole matrix through
  > `dbt parse` and asserts it, in seconds, with no credentials.

  > `iceberg` and `duckrun` both belong to the DuckDB family but have **different** adapter
  > `type`s, and `iceberg`/`ducklake`-style engines report `type: duckdb`. Where the two DuckDB
  > engines differ at all, the code keys on `target.name`, not `target.type`.

- **One shared download step** (`download_aemo.py`) — the only Python in the repo. It lands
  the raw AEMO files, **uncompressed**, into a *separate landing lakehouse*, plus a watermark
  `csv_raw_archive_log.parquet`. Every engine then just **reads those files with SQL**. Landing
  plain CSV is the key enabler: Fabric Warehouse `OPENROWSET` can't read gzip, and DuckDB/Spark
  read plain fine — so one landed format feeds all four.

## The pipeline

`stg_csv_archive_log` (view over the landed log) → `dim_calendar`, `dim_duid` → the daily and
intraday facts `fct_price[_today]`, `fct_scada[_today]` → `fct_summary` (the Power BI-facing
`(date, time, DUID)` grain joining generation to price). Every engine emits this identical set of
tables.

Every fact model writes with a keyed, insert-only strategy — never `append`, which has no
write-time key check and lets two overlapping runs both insert the same file. Each engine spells
that differently because the adapters differ: duckrun `insert`, iceberg `merge` +
`when_matched: do_nothing` (its catalog rejects multi-snapshot commits), spark `merge` +
`skip_matched_step`, and dwh a plain `merge`, the one adapter that cannot drop the matched
branch. **De-duplication removed the copy-paste, not the real engine differences.**

## Run it

### Quick, offline (DuckDB → local Delta)

```bash
pip install duckrun                 # brings dbt-duckdb, duckdb, deltalake
export FILES_PATH=./landing         # where the script lands raw CSVs
export ONELAKE_TABLES_PATH=./warehouse   # where duckrun writes Delta tables
python download_aemo.py             # land the raw CSVs once, then:
dbt build --target duckrun          # models + tests, one DAG walk
```

### The other engines

Install the adapter and set the engine's env vars, then `dbt build --target <name>`:

| target | adapter | key env vars |
|---|---|---|
| `iceberg` | `dbt-duckdb` | `WAREHOUSE_PATH`, `ONELAKE_ENDPOINT`, `ONELAKE_TOKEN`, `FILES_PATH` |
| `dwh` | `dbt-fabric` (needs Python ≥ 3.12) | `FABRIC_DWH_SERVER`, `FABRIC_DWH_NAME`, `FABRIC_AUTH`, `FILES_PATH` |
| `spark` | `dbt-fabricspark` | `FABRIC_WORKSPACE_ID`, `FABRIC_LAKEHOUSE_ID`, `FABRIC_LAKEHOUSE_NAME`, `FABRIC_AUTH`, `FILES_PATH` |

All four share `FILES_PATH` (the landing lakehouse) and `DBT_SCHEMA` (default `mart`).

## CI — all four engines on real OneLake

`.github/workflows/dbt.yml` runs the pipeline on **all four engines against Microsoft Fabric /
OneLake**. It's a matrix job (one per engine) that, in the `testing` workspace:

1. provisions the engine's Fabric item(s) **if missing** — a lakehouse for
   duckrun/iceberg/spark, a lakehouse + warehouse for dwh (`.github/scripts/provision.py`);
2. lands the raw AEMO files into that lakehouse's `Files` with the shared notebook;
3. `dbt build` against OneLake for that target — each engine writes and tests its own output in
   one DAG walk. A final `summary` job then reads all four items back through Delta and puts
   every shared table side by side — the staging view, the four facts, then `dim_calendar` /
   `dim_duid` / `fct_summary`, so a disagreement in the summary can be traced to its inputs on
   the rows above; that parity table
   is the only thing comparing engines to each other. The singular tests are written per dialect
   (`tests/duckdb`, `tests/dwh`, `tests/spark`, gated per folder in `dbt_project.yml`), so all
   four targets run the same assertions against the output they just wrote.

Auth is **OIDC only** (the `fabric-github-deploy` app is Admin in the workspace) — the repo
needs just `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` / `AZURE_TENANT_ID` secrets and a federated credential.

**This account presents the IMMUTABLE subject form, and it embeds the repo NAME**, so the credential
this repo actually authenticates with is:

```
repo:djouallah@12554469/fabric-dbt-benchmark@1310610554:ref:refs/heads/main
       ^owner  ^owner id  ^repo name        ^repo id
```

Two things follow, both learned the expensive way when this repo was renamed from `djouallah/dbt` on
2026-08-01:

- **A rename breaks OIDC even though the repo ID does not change.** The name sits in the middle of
  that string, so "immutable" means the ids are pinned, not that the subject survives a rename. The
  old `dbt_main_immutable` credential carries the *same* owner id and the *same* repo id
  (`1310610554`) and still stopped matching.
- **Adding the plain `repo:<owner>/<repo>:ref:...` form does not help**, because with immutable
  identifiers enabled that form is never presented. A credential for it sits there looking correct
  and matching nothing. `fabric_dbt_benchmark_main` is exactly that, kept only as a fallback if the
  account setting is ever turned off.

The failure is `AADSTS700213: No matching federated identity record found for presented assertion
subject '…'` at the `azure/login` step. **Read the subject in that error and create a credential for
it verbatim** — it is the authoritative statement of what GitHub is sending, and it reads like a
missing secret if you skip it:

```bash
az ad app federated-credential create --id <appId> --parameters @fic.json
```

The old `dbt_main` and `dbt_main_immutable` credentials were **deleted** on 2026-08-01, right after
the new ones were verified green. `dbt_main` in particular was a standing trust for a repo name that
could be created again, and the app is Admin in the workspace — so the trust list should carry
nothing that does not currently authenticate something. Keep it that way: when a repo is renamed or
retired, remove its credential in the same pass that adds the replacement.

### Where the DuckDB-family build actually runs

In a Fabric notebook, always. `duckrun` and `iceberg` are both just DuckDB in a Python process, so
that process *could* live on the GitHub runner — but CI no longer tries to decide. `fabric_run.py`
zips the project into a throwaway notebook via `duckrun.run_python` and runs `fabric_build.py`
there, data-local to OneLake, so a backlog drain never pulls the corpus over the public internet.
`dwh` and `spark` never had the choice: their compute *is* Fabric's server, and the runner only
ever holds the dbt client.

Two placement heuristics were tried and removed. The first asked whether `land` had downloaded a
new `PUBLIC_DAILY` file, which describes the download rather than the backlog — a from-scratch
lakehouse has the whole ~3000-file archive waiting with nothing new landed, and that reads as
"small". The second counted each engine's genuinely pending files, but had to read that count
through the very tables the build was about to write, so an unreadable table collapsed the
estimate to its fail-safe sentinel regardless.

The saving on offer was one Fabric session start-up on quiet intraday runs. The cost of being
wrong was a 7GB runner thrashing through a full archive fold. One path is worth more than the
saving.

### Verify offline (no warehouse)

Targets also compile without connecting — useful locally:

```bash
dbt parse   --target duckrun     # manifest builds, enabled gates leave one model per name
dbt compile --target duckrun     # renders the DuckDB SQL (writes local Delta if run)
```

## Tests

Six assertions, over three tables, and **no test reads more than the one table it is about**:

| test | table | what it catches |
|---|---|---|
| `assert_fct_summary_grain` | `fct_summary` | a duplicate `(date, time, DUID)` — full table, no window |
| `unique` + `not_null` on `DUID` | `dim_duid` | a duplicate or missing unit key |
| `assert_duid_has_no_whitespace` | `dim_duid` | a padded `DUID`, which T-SQL matches and DuckDB/Spark don't |
| `unique` + `not_null` on `date` | `dim_calendar` | a duplicate or missing calendar date |

`fct_summary` is asserted for **uniqueness and nothing else**. It makes no claim about intervals
per day, unit counts, which dates should exist, or whether `mw`/`price` agree with the facts they
came from — so it cannot go red because AEMO published a short day or a backlog drained halfway.
The flip side is that it is the *only* thing watching that table: drift from `f(inputs)`, craters,
NULL prices and duplicates in the raw facts are all unasserted by design. The fact models and the
staging view carry descriptions and no tests at all.

Cross-engine agreement is not tested either — every assertion compares a table to itself. The
row-count parity table in the `summary` job is the one place the four outputs are compared.

All six assertions run on **all four** targets. Generic column tests dbt renders per adapter
dialect; the singular tests are written out per dialect, one folder each under `tests/`
(`duckdb`, `dwh`, `spark`), with `data_tests` in `dbt_project.yml` enabling exactly one folder per
target — the same gating models use. That matters most for `dwh`, the one engine whose writes can
genuinely race and the one where a whitespace-padded join key silently succeeds.

Note the gate belongs on the **folder** key, not on `aemo_electricity`: a generic test's fqn has no
folder segment, so a project-level `+enabled` switches those off too. It did, for a while, and both
`dwh` and `spark` ran zero tests while the docs claimed otherwise.
