"""Deploy one semantic model per engine over that engine's own `mart.fct_summary`.

The experiment is: **one DAX suite, four identical semantic models, four dbt adapters.** The adapter
that wrote the parquet is the only variable; everything on top of it is held constant on purpose. So
there is ONE `.bim`, deployed four times, and every knob that could differ per engine has been
removed rather than left configurable.

`ws.deploy()` takes two arguments here, and only the first varies:

  `lakehouse=` / `warehouse=`  — WHICH item holds the tables, from the item's kind (engines.KIND).
                                 duckrun raises rather than silently pointing elsewhere if the wrong
                                 one is passed.
  `mode=`                      — HOW it is read: `engines.DEPLOY_MODE`, one constant, Direct Lake.
                                 duckrun rewrites every table to an entity partition over one
                                 AzureStorage.DataLake expression on the item's OneLake root and sets
                                 directLakeBehavior=directLakeOnly, so a query Direct Lake cannot
                                 serve FAILS rather than falling back to the SQL endpoint and logging
                                 a pushdown time that would read as a slow layout.

Requires duckrun >= 0.4.36, which made `mode=` independent of the item kind. Before it a warehouse
could only be read by DirectQuery, which is why `dwh` used to be measured differently from the other
three — a second hand-authored template, hot-only, no reframe, scoped out of every COLD table. A
warehouse's Tables are Delta in OneLake like any other item's, so that asymmetry was never about the
storage, and it is gone: all four are now the same measurement.

Every model is Direct Lake, so every deploy REFRESHES (a reframe onto the latest Delta) and returns
only once the model is live. Nothing is written to any lakehouse — the models read tables the dbt run
already produced.

**Each model is DELETED before it is deployed**, so the deploy creates a new item rather than
updating one in place. That is the benchmark's cold guarantee: a newly created dataset has an empty
VertiPaq store, so pass 1 of the session pays the full transcode. `overwrite=True` alone keeps the
item id and can inherit the previous dispatch's resident columns. See `_delete_existing` for the
alternatives that were checked and rejected, and for the costs.

    **This is the benchmark's cold guarantee, and the only reset in the run.** A newly created
    dataset has an empty VertiPaq store — "After the initial semantic model load, no column data is
    resident in memory yet. Direct Lake is cold." — so pass 1 of the measurement pays the full
    Delta->memory transcode. `overwrite=True` on its own does NOT give that: it updates the
    definition in place and keeps the item id, so residency can survive from the previous dispatch.

    There is no non-destructive way to force cold, and each alternative was checked and rejected:
    TMSL `clearCache` clears query caches but leaves resident columns alone (it is a hot->warm
    lever); reframing is *incremental* and retains dictionaries, so it lands at semiwarm at best;
    memory pressure and node reassignment do produce cold state but neither is commandable. See
    benchmark/README.md.

    The accepted cost is one extra item GUID per dispatch in the Capacity Metrics app's item list.
    It does not break `cu/` — that tool resolves names live from the REST API precisely because a
    recreate mints a new GUID — and the display name never changes, so CU stays attributed.

    The other trade, stated because it is a real regression: if this delete succeeds and the deploy
    then fails, the engine is left with NO model, where an overwrite failure used to leave the
    previous one standing. Acceptable here because the model is rebuilt from the template every run
    and nothing between runs depends on it.

    Best-effort on the lookup, deliberate on the delete: if the item cannot be listed we let the
    deploy overwrite as before (and say so), because a benchmark that refuses to run is worse than
    one that warns its first pass may not be cold.

    Returns the deleted item id, or None if there was nothing to delete.
