"""Guards on the semantic-model template, checked against duckrun's OWN regexes.

Every assertion here fails at *deploy* time otherwise — after the job has already installed
ADOMD.NET and resolved the workspace — or worse, deploys something that quietly points at the wrong
item or the wrong query mode. All of it is a JSON read; no Fabric, no network.

There is ONE template, deployed to every engine, and that is the experiment: identical DAX over
identical semantic models, with the dbt adapter that wrote the parquet as the only variable. A second
template, or a per-engine storage mode, would put a second variable in the comparison.

There were two, briefly — this one plus a hand-authored `fct_summary_dq.SemanticModel` — because
before duckrun 0.4.36 a warehouse could only be read by DirectQuery. They had to be kept in lockstep
or the one DAX suite silently stopped being comparable, and the dwh timings measured SQL-endpoint
pushdown rather than a layout. `deploy(mode=)` made the mode independent of the item kind, so the copy
is gone and every engine is Direct Lake.

The deleted file's sharpest trap, worth remembering if anyone ever hand-authors a DirectQuery bim
instead of passing `mode=`: `_is_directlake_bim()` greps the model.bim's RAW BYTES for the camelCase
Direct-Lake token, so a *description string* mentioning the mode was enough to flip it and make deploy
attempt a reframe the model could not serve. Prose counts. It caught that for real, once.
