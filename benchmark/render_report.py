"""Render run_report.json to the GitHub job summary AND compute the derived `analysis` block,
which is merged back into the same file. Pure post-processing, pure timing — everything here is
recomputable offline from the cold samples and hot runs already in run_report.json.

**There is no reference engine and no baseline.** Every engine is measured the same way against the
same DAX, so the report ranks them and names the fastest per query; nothing is stated as a ratio
against one privileged engine. That used to be the shape — `BENCH_ENGINES[0]` was the reference and
every ratio read `base ÷ challenger` — inherited from upstream, where there genuinely was a baseline:
it built a candidate layout and compared it to the existing one. Here the four engines are four peers,
so a baseline was an arbitrary choice that made every number in the report depend on the order the
dispatch happened to list them in, and made "iceberg 1.30× faster" mean nothing without remembering
which engine the reference was. Ratios are now stated against the FASTEST engine of the metric, which
is a property of the measurement rather than of the input list.

Deliberately NO parquet/geometry analysis. Physical layout (files, row groups, size, v-order,
compression) is already reported per engine by `.github/scripts/stats.py` in the `layout` job of the `dbt` workflow;
duplicating it here would mean a second, slower reader of the same Delta logs saying the same thing.
This measures wall-clock and nothing else.
