"""Regression guards for the Direct Lake benchmark's ranking layer.

Ported from duckrun's `tests/parquet_layout/test_verdicts.py`, where the layer read a base/model
ratio with the wrong orientation and could report the FASTER layout as the loser. That whole shape is
gone: **there is no reference engine and no baseline here** — upstream genuinely had one (it built a
candidate layout and compared it against the existing one), while these four engines are peers, so a
baseline made every number depend on the order the dispatch happened to list them in.

What is pinned now:
  * the ranking is ordered by total, rank 1 is the lowest total, and `× fastest` is ≥ 1 (the direction
    guard, in the only form still expressible);
  * fastest-wins with no tie band — a 1ms win is a win, and the per-query `best` column names an
    engine rather than "tie";
  * column order is neutral and stable (alphabetical), never the dispatch's engine order and never
    the result order;
  * totals are summed over a query set every participating engine answered, and hot-only engines are
    scoped out of the COLD column rather than emptying it;
  * the analysis stays timing-only.

Pure functions only — no Fabric, no XMLA, no network. This is the free CI gate that runs before any
paid capacity is spent.
