"""Specialist findings for the query benchmark. Reads ONLY run_report.json and recomputes every
number from it (nothing hardcoded); appends to the CI job summary ($GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY) and prints
to stdout — no file artifact. Medians only — never a mean in any comparison.

**No baseline.** Engines are ranked and the fastest is named; nothing is stated as a ratio against a
privileged engine (see render_report's module docstring for why the reference was removed).

Timing only, by design: physical layout per engine is `.github/scripts/stats.py` in the *Parity
dashboard* workflow, and is not re-derived here.

Exits 1 on a ranking inconsistency — the one thing here that can fail the job, and deliberately so:
a report that names the slower engine the winner is worse than no report.
