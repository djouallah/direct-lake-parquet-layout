# To do

Open work that needs a decision or a dispatch. Not a wishlist — an item earns a place here by being
something a future session would otherwise have to rediscover.

[README.md](README.md) states the thesis, [LEARNINGS.md](LEARNINGS.md) records the investigations,
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) records the rules those imply, [RETROSPECTIVE.md](RETROSPECTIVE.md) what the
exercise cost. This file is what has not been done.

## 2 of 16 layout groups are EXCLUDED from *Cost and speed by parquet layout*

**The `etl CU (8 vCores)` column is shown, and a layout with no run at that core count is dropped
from the section entirely** — table and chart alike, with the count named in a note under the table.
Fourteen rows survive today, all complete.

This replaced hiding the column while 7 of 17 rows could not fill it: a cost column that is mostly
dashes reads as "the build was free" rather than "nobody measured it at that size". Dropping the row
means every row that IS there is complete. **What it costs is the chart** — 14 dots instead of 16 —
so two layouts' query timings leave a section they had every right to be in, for a build-cost
reason. They are still in *Every run*.

The filter is on MEMBERSHIP, not on the value: a layout built at 8 vCores whose CU the ledger has not
read yet keeps its row and dashes that one cell. "Measured, not yet costed" is not "never built".
No group is in that state today — all 16 carry analytics CU, so the 2 that are missing are missing a
BUILD, not a ledger read.

**16, not 17 — `iceberg` left the dashboard entirely** (`PAGE_OMIT` in `dashboard/app.js`): its
layout group was one of the kept rows, so the group count fell by one and the excluded count did not
move. The runs are still in `history/`; the page just does not report that engine.

*Cost and speed by parquet layout* reports build cost at ONE core count, because build cost tracks
the machine and `layoutKey` does not carry `vcores` — a group holds runs from several machines and a
median over them describes none of them (measured: one duckrun layout reads **9,986 CU at 8 vCores
against 22,547 blended** across 8/16/32/64). See the `ETL_VCORES` comment in `dashboard/app.js`.

Two groups have never been built at 8 vCores. Both are duckrun; both exist only at 64
cores. **Building them is what puts them back on the page.**

**⚠️ The nightly does NOT fill these in, and an earlier note claiming it would was wrong.** The
nightly builds one layout — `sort_by=date,time,price` at `row_group_size=2000000`, 72 row groups —
and that group already has 8-core runs (it reads 9,897). A layout group is keyed on the sort columns
and a band of the row-group count, so both of the two below are layouts the nightly never
writes. Filling them needs a deliberate dispatch each.

| `sort_by` | row groups | `row_group_size` to dispatch | runs in the group |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `date,time,DUID` | 19–24 | `6000000` | 2 |
| `date,DUID,time` | 24 | `6000000` | 5 |

Both want the SAME `row_group_size` — they are one row-group band (16–31) and differ only in the
sort key, so what is left is two dispatches of `6000000` at two sort orders. Both are a DUID sort,
which is the one dimension the 8-vCore fleet has never covered.

`row_group_size` is DERIVED (`143,980,961 ÷ row groups`) because most of these records predate that
dispatch input and carry no `inputs.row_group_size` to copy.

Each row is one `Benchmark` dispatch at **`cores=8`** with that `sort_by` and `row_group_size`,
everything else default.

**Five of the original seven have been dispatched by hand and have landed** — they are on the page
now and are not in the table above:

| `sort_by` | `row_group_size` | run | row groups written |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| `date,time` | `6000000` | 31260566919 | 24 |
| `date,time` | `2000000` | 31257464517 | 72 |
| `date,time,price` | `1000000` | 31257855850 | 144 |
| `date,time` | `1000000` | 31297053137 | 144 |
| `date,time,price` | `6000000` | 31300101128 | 24 |

Each landed in the band it was aimed at, so the derived `row_group_size` above is confirmed as the
way to hit a band rather than a guess.

**The cost is real and is the reason this is a to-do rather than a task.** Two from-scratch builds
of 370M rows plus their query passes. At 8 vCores the CU rate is `cores / 2` = 4/s and a build reads
~10,000 CU, so each is ~40 minutes of compute and the pair is roughly **20,000 CU**.

Three ways to close it, in rough order of preference:

1. **Dispatch the two.** They rejoin the section as they land — no code change at all, and five
   of the original seven have already closed this way.
2. **Leave them excluded.** The status quo, and defensible: fourteen complete rows say more than
   sixteen part-empty ones, and the missing runs' query numbers are still in *Every run*.
3. **Lower `ETL_VCORES` coverage by re-pinning it.** Only worth it if the fleet's usual core count
   moves; the constant already has to be kept in step with the dispatch default by hand, and moving
   it to chase coverage would make the column mean whatever happens to be best populated.

Do **not** close it by widening the filter to blend core counts. That is the thing the column was
built to stop.

### Running the set — SERIALLY, and there is no other way

**Two `Benchmark` runs must never overlap** (see the invariant in CLAUDE.md: shared capacity gets
throttled, which inflates both runs' numbers silently, and `ensure()` reuses an output item by name
so two duckrun runs would build into one `mart.fct_summary`). The concurrency group is per REF, so it
does not stop `--ref other-branch` — nothing enforces this but the operator.

The queue cannot be pre-loaded either: `cancel-in-progress: false` allows one running plus **one**
pending, and a third dispatch evicts the queued one rather than stacking.

So chain them. Dispatch, wait for that run to finish, dispatch the next:

```bash
# one "sort_by:row_group_size" per remaining layout
for spec in "date,time,DUID:6000000" "date,DUID,time:6000000"; do
  # never dispatch while anything is live — this is the serialisation
  while gh run list --workflow Benchmark --limit 20         --json status -q '.[].status' | grep -qE 'in_progress|queued|pending'; do sleep 60; done
  gh workflow run Benchmark -f engines=duckrun -f cores=8      -f sort_by="${spec%%:*}" -f row_group_size="${spec##*:}"
  sleep 30                                   # let the run register before the next poll
done
```

The `while` is the important line, not the `for`: it waits on ANY live Benchmark run, so the loop
serialises against a nightly or a hand dispatch too, not just against itself. Budget ~1–1.5 h per
iteration — an 8-vCore build is cheaper in CU than a 64-core one but slower on the clock — so the
pair is two to three hours.
