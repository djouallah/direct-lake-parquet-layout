/**
 * Offline tests for the page. No token, no network, no Fabric, no browser — which is the property
 * being kept. `node --test cu/`
 *
 * What matters here is the JOIN. Attribution used to be substring matching on display names with a
 * `shared` bucket for anything ambiguous; it is now a dictionary lookup on the item GUID, and the class
 * comes from the role the run itself recorded. If that join is wrong the page prints a confident number
 * under the wrong engine, which is the failure this directory exists to avoid.
 *
 * These are the tests `cu/test_dashboard.py` carried, ported when the render layer moved from Python to
 * the browser. That port is the reason they exist in this file rather than being rewritten: the rules
 * they pin — that landing CU never reaches a column, that a dash is not a zero, that a variant tag
 * never contains the column separator — were each learned from a page that printed something wrong,
 * and none of them became less true for being enforced in a different language.
 *
 * The render layer produces STRINGS, so `plain()` and `rows()` turn a fragment back into something an
 * assertion can read: `<strong>` becomes `**` and `<code>` becomes a backtick, which is exactly what
 * the markdown-era assertions were written against.
