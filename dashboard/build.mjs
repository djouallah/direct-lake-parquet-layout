/**
 * One HTML file out of `index.html` + `app.js`, twice — the live page and the frozen copy.
 *
 *     node dashboard/build.mjs --out site/index.html               # live: fetches history/ at load time
 *     node dashboard/build.mjs --out dashboard.html --snapshot     # offline: history/ inlined
 *
 * **The live page is the ONLY thing Pages publishes, and it carries no data.** That is the point of
 * the whole arrangement: `Benchmark` commits a run record, `Dashboard`'s measure job commits the
 * ledger, and the published page picks both up on the next load. Publishing became what you do when
 * the VISUALISATION changes.
 *
 * **The snapshot copy exists because the artifact has to survive.** `dashboard.html` is uploaded per
 * run and has to open from a local disk with no network years later, which a page that fetches cannot
 * do. Same file, same render path, data from a different place — `app.js` prefers an inlined
 * `#snapshot` over the network when one is present, so there is exactly one implementation of the join
 * and no way for the two copies to disagree.
 *
 * No dependencies, and no bundler: `app.js` is a single ES module and this concatenates it into the
 * shell. Node's own `--test` runner covers the module; this file is 80 lines of string substitution.
