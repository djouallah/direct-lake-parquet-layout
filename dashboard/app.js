/**
 * The page. Reads the run records and the CU ledger, joins them on the ITEM GUID, renders HTML.
 *
 * **This runs in the browser, against `history/` on `main`, at VIEW time.** That is the whole point
 * of it: `Benchmark` commits a run record, `Capacity units` commits the ledger, and the published
 * page picks both up on the next load. Publishing is what happens when the VISUALISATION changes —
 * `Dashboard` fires on a push to `dashboard/**` and does nothing else. It used to mean "when a number
 * changed", because measuring and deploying were two jobs of one workflow, which made every new
 * measurement cost a Pages deploy.
 *
 * **It must fetch from `raw.githubusercontent.com`, not from the Pages origin.** Serving `history/`
 * out of `site/` would put the data back inside the published artifact and make every commit a
 * republish again. Raw serves the repo's own files with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` and a ~5
 * minute CDN TTL, which is what makes a page hosted on `djouallah.github.io` able to read them at all.
 * The repo is public, so nothing here is a new disclosure — the item GUIDs have always been committed.
 *
 * **Two JSON documents, joined on one key.** `history/runs/<ts>-<run id>.json` is written by the
 * `Benchmark` workflow and names every Fabric item GUID that run created, with its role, plus the
 * layout, the input archive and the raw query timings. `history/cu.json` is the cumulative ledger
 * `measure.py` builds, `{item GUID: {operation: CU}}`. Nothing else passes between them.
 *
 * That join replaces the whole apparatus the old page needed. Attribution used to be substring
 * matching on item DISPLAY NAMES, with a `shared` column for everything ambiguous, a lagging `'Items'`
 * snapshot for kinds, and heuristics — idle-hour gaps, repeated model names — to guess where one run
 * ended and the next began. Now every item bar the landing lakehouse is created and destroyed inside
 * one run, so a GUID belongs to exactly one run and the class comes from the role WE recorded. There
 * is no `shared`, no `engine_of`, no sessionize.
 *
 * Properties worth keeping:
 *
 * - **ONE implementation.** This module both draws the live page and, with a snapshot inlined, the
 *   offline artifact copy — `build.mjs` produces both from this file. There is deliberately no second
 *   renderer: `dashboard.py` and `report_html.py` were deleted rather than kept alongside, because two
 *   implementations of this join is exactly the drift the rest of the repo is built to avoid.
 * - **No build step for data, and no third-party package anywhere.** Plain ES modules and `fetch`.
 *   DuckDB-WASM was considered and rejected: ~30 MB of wasm to query 300 KB of JSON that already
 *   arrives in the shape the page wants.
 * - **It renders what the records CONTAIN.** One engine, two, a dispatch that skipped the benchmark
 *   and so has no directlake CU: the columns come from the records, never from a configured list. An
 *   engine nothing ever measured has no zero to print.
 * - **The page is composed from EVERY record** — each engine's latest run, once per config. One
 *   dispatch builds one engine, so rendering the newest record alone would give a comparison page with
 *   one column. `?record=` pins one run when reproducing an old page.
 *
 * The render layer produces STRINGS, never DOM nodes, and touches no global at import time. That is
 * what lets `app.test.mjs` run the whole page under `node --test` with no browser and no jsdom.

/**
 * WHAT WAS DISPATCHED — `[engine, resource profile, sort, row group size, file size, V-Order
 * declared, V-Order measured]`, and that is what a layout row IS.
 *
 * **THE KEY IS THE DECLARED WRITE CONFIG. THIS REVERSES "grouping is MEASURED, labelling is
 * DECLARED", which held for as long as nobody dispatched a knob whose ANSWER moved.** It keyed on the
 * parquet that came out — a power-of-two band of the row-group count, plus the columns duckrun's
 * picker had resolved to — and that made one profile look like several. Measured on nyc: six duckrun
 * runs dispatched with identical config (`sorted`, `row_group_size: auto`, `file_size_mb: auto`)
 * rendered as THREE rows, because the picker answered `…payment_type` twice, `…payment_type,
 * tip_amount` three times and `…payment_type, fare_amount` once, landing at 68 / 63 / 58 row groups.
 * Every printed cell on those three rows was identical — `delta_rs`, `auto`, `yes` — so the table
 * showed a split it could not explain, over a distinction nobody had asked for.
 *
 * **`auto` is ONE profile however the picker answers on a given night.** What the dispatcher chose is
 * `auto`; which columns that resolves to is the picker's ANSWER, and an answer that moves run to run
 * is a property of the picker rather than a second layout somebody ordered. A run that NAMES its
 * columns is a different profile — `sortLabelOf` returns the list against the literal `auto`, so the
 * picker's runs still never merge into a hand-declared row, which is the comparison the old
 * `auto:`-prefixed key existed to protect. `auto` at a custom `row_group_size` is different again.
 *
 * **WHAT THE MERGE COSTS IS PAID IN THE OPEN.** A row now holds parquet that genuinely differs — that
 * nyc row spans 58–68 row groups and 7,251–8,596 MB — and its CU and query times are a median across
 * it. `keyCells` prints the RG, row-group-size and MB SPANS, so the variation is stated by the row
 * that owns it: one row reading `8.7–10.2M · 7,251–8,596 MB · 6 runs` says the picker is unstable and
 * roughly by how much, where three rows reading `auto` said nothing at all. The median over six runs
 * is also the sturdier number — see `groupMid`, and the capacity weather it exists to damp.
 *
 * `vcores` and `native_execution_engine` are excluded, and that is measured rather than assumed:
 * duckrun wrote 4 files / 27 row groups at 64 cores and at 32, and spark wrote one layout with NEE on
 * and off. Neither reaches the parquet. `LAYOUT_CONFIG` excludes them from the row's NAME for the
 * same reason.
 *
 * **THE LAST ELEMENT IS MEASURED, AND IT IS A DETECTOR RATHER THAN A DIMENSION.** `vorderOf` is the
 * `sys.databases` readback on dwh and the Delta property or Spark tag elsewhere; it sits beside the
 * DECLARED `vorder` and agrees with it on every record in `history/` — spark's profile decides it,
 * dwh's input decides it, and the DuckDB pair has no V-Order encoder at all — so it adds no rows
 * today. What it buys is that a dwh run declaring `vorder: true` whose irreversible `ALTER` silently
 * did nothing keys as `(true, false)` and gets a row of its own, instead of being averaged into
 * either cohort under a cell that reads like the other one.
 *
 * **THERE IS NO `null` RETURN AND NO UNMEASURED CASE.** A record with no `layout.config` entry is a
 * default-profile run, which is a real key rather than a hole — which is also how the geometry reads:
 * `stats.py` records `row_group_size`/`file_size_mb` only when they differ from the pinned
 * `16000000` baseline, so an absent one means the baseline for every record ever written, never
 * "unknown". Keying on the dispatch instead of on the parquet is what deletes the whole unmeasured
 * branch, and `layoutGroups`' fallback-to-column with it.

 * answer here reads off the shape rather than off any single row: the cheapest layouts are the
 * SLOWEST, so paying more CU does not buy latency.
 *
 * WHY EACH LAYOUT IS A LINE AND NOT A DOT, and it replaced two whole charts. The page carried *CU
 * against cold* and *cold against warm*: both plotted `cold ms` on x, so a reader wanting all three
 * numbers carried one between two panels, and the quantity that actually matters — what the cold
 * transcode COSTS over the warm pass — was on neither. Giving a point a second x on the SAME axis
 * turns that subtraction into a LENGTH, which is the one thing the eye reads without arithmetic.
 * The two ends carry no markers on purpose: the length is the reading, and end markers meant a
 * second grammar (which fill is which tier, what the area means) to learn before it could be read.
 *
 * ONE TIME AXIS, NEVER TWO. Both tiers are milliseconds; two scales for two measures of the same
 * kind is the dual-axis mistake, and a length spanning two scales is not a quantity. The separation
 * that results — warm bunched at the left, cold spread across the right — IS the finding: the
 * second visit is 5-8x cheaper and how much cheaper varies by layout, which is what the varying
 * lengths say. Warm is always the LEFT end because it is always the smaller number.
 *
 * NOT ZERO-BASED as a RULE: a scatter shows association, not magnitude, so the axes bracket the
 * data. (The zero-baseline rule is a BAR rule — a truncated bar misstates a ratio, a truncated
 * scatter axis does not.) On today's data the time axis reaches 0 anyway, because the combined span
 * snaps `niceScale`'s step to 5,000 — a consequence of the numbers, not a policy.

 * INT64s (618.6 MB); under `readHeavyForPBI` it keeps it (423.1 MB). Direct Lake can remap a parquet
 * dictionary into VertiPaq's own; a PLAIN column has to be dictionary-built at load.
 *
 * **THE TEST IS DIALECT-AWARE, and it has to be.** `dict_pages == chunks` on every column of every
 * run here, so that field discriminates nothing. What does is `PLAIN` sitting beside a dictionary
 * encoding — and what `PLAIN` MEANS depends on the parquet version the writer used:
 *
 * - **v2** (`RLE_DICTIONARY` present — arrow-rs, so duckrun and iceberg): data pages are
 *   `RLE_DICTIONARY` and the DICTIONARY PAGE itself is `PLAIN`. So `PLAIN` is always there and is
 *   never evidence of a fallback.
 * - **v1** (`PLAIN_DICTIONARY` present — parquet-mr, so spark): `PLAIN_DICTIONARY` covers both page
 *   kinds, so a separate `PLAIN` can only be data pages that abandoned the dictionary.
 *
 * Read the v1 rule off `writeHeavy`, where exactly `mw` and `price` carry `PLAIN` and the other four
 * columns do not; the naive "PLAIN means fallback" rule would instead condemn every duckrun column
 * on this page.
 *
 * **KNOWN BLIND SPOT:** in v2 a genuine fallback also writes `PLAIN` data pages, which is
 * indistinguishable from the dictionary page in a set of encoding names. So this reads `yes` for a
 * v2 writer that did fall back. Telling those apart needs per-PAGE metadata, which
 * `parquet_metadata()` does not carry — `stats.py` would have to record the encoding of each page,
 * not the set per column chunk.

/**
 * COLD AGAINST WARM, one dot per layout, sized by CU.
 *
 * **THIS REPLACES THE LINE CHART, which drew each layout as a segment from its warm ms to its cold
 * ms at the height of its CU.** The segment carried all three numbers in one mark and read well at
 * eleven layouts. At seventeen — nine of them one writer, at similar CU — it stopped: a line is a WIDE
 * mark, it spans most of a decade on a log x, so nine of them overlap into a hatch that no hover
 * pulls apart. A dot occupies one point, and points separate.
 *
 * WHAT MOVED, and each of the three is deliberate:
 * - **CU is the AREA now, not the y axis.** It is the measure this project optimises for, and area
 *   is the channel that survives crowding — a dot keeps its size wherever it lands, while a y
 *   position is spent on separating marks. It also frees y for the second time measure.
 * - **Warm is the y axis**, so the chart is cold against warm: what a first visit costs against what
 *   every visit after it costs.
 * - **Colour stays the WRITER.** The legend, the layout rows and the table all name writers, and
 *   recolouring by engine would fold spark's three profiles into one hue while the table beside it
 *   kept them apart.
 *
 * THE COST, stated rather than discovered later: the cold/warm TRADE was the line's LENGTH and is
 * now a distance from the diagonal, which is a worse encoding of it. That is the price of separating
 * seventeen marks, and the ratio is still one line of every dot's hover.
 *
 * BOTH AXES LOG, which the pre-line version did not have. Cold spans 22,823-45,010 against warm at
 * 3,000-6,500, and a linear axis pinned every dot into a corner. Log is orthogonal to the mark.

 * EVERY run the page drew from — which dispatch, what it cost, and whether that cost can still rise.

 * The one thing a composed page owes the reader that a single-run page did not: the columns are
 * different dispatches, so a column can be days older than the one beside it. The other half is that a
 * run measured minutes ago is a LOWER BOUND — an hour's CU keeps growing for ~70 minutes after the
 * fact — so the reader is told to dispatch again rather than left to wonder.
 *
 * **THE RUN IS THE KEY — one row per dispatch, and nothing is marked or ranked against a column.**
 * This listed one run per column, so the runs that hold no column were invisible while still moving
 * every bar: a `duckrun sorted` bar read 2,454.1 and no row on the page said so. A number on a chart
 * with no row behind it is exactly what this table exists to prevent. The rows that also hold a column
 * carry no annotation saying so — which run is newest is already in the `built` column, and a marker
 * on top of it was inventing a second grammar for a fact the sort order states.
 *
 * It carries the two class totals as well, which is why `ledger` is a parameter rather than a leftover.
 * Everywhere else the two halves are read a table apart from the run that produced them; here they sit
 * on the row that names the dispatch, its build mode and whether the number has settled — the four
 * facts that qualify a CU figure, in one place.

 * table, so printing them in every block would read as one measurement per table. That block's rows
 * are ordered by that CU, cheapest first; the rest keep the engine order.
 *
 * **A row is a `producer()`, not a column.** `spark readHeavyForPBI` and `spark writeHeavy`, not

 * settings each collapse to one row, and they had written identical layouts, so the rows they replaced
 * were the same row printed twice.
 *
 * **The MART block takes its rows from the chart's own groups, and the other blocks stay per
 * producer.** That is what keeps the two agreeing when a producer wrote more than one layout: the mart
 * block is the only one carrying CU and query time, so it is the only one where a row that averaged two
 * different shapes would print a number belonging to neither — which is exactly what `duckrun sorted`
 * did, quoting the mean of a 3-file run and a 4-file one on a row showing 4 files. Per group, that
 * producer has two mart rows and the `files`/`row groups` columns say which is which. The other blocks
 * are physical layout alone and describe a table the mart's shape says nothing about, so splitting them
 * the same way would print the same row twice for a difference that is not in it.
 *
 * **`cold`/`warm`/`hot` are here rather than in a section of their own, and that placement is the
 * point.** They were briefly a table further down the page, which put the layout and the speed it
 * produced on two different tables — and the only question worth asking of these numbers is whether
 * one explains the other. On one row, `files`, `row groups`, `rows per RG` and `V-Order` sit beside the
 * milliseconds they produced, and a reader can see for themselves whether a smaller file count bought
 * a faster first visit. Cold especially: it is the tier that transcodes columns out of parquet, so it
 * is the one layout can move at all.

 * (5.63 bytes/row) and does not win, dwh writes UNCOMPRESSED and beats a SNAPPY spark build, and
 * spark's two resource profiles write the same row-group size 2.6x apart. What Power BI actually
 * pays for on a cold pass is transcoding parquet into VertiPaq segments, and how expensive that is
 * depends on what the columns are ENCODED as — the one property nothing measured.
 *
 * Keyed on the LAYOUT, like the query-cost chart, because encoding is a property of what was written.
 * The newest member of a group that carries a profile wins — members of one group were dispatched
 * with the same write config, and `stats.py` reads the encodings from the same item it read the shape
 * from. Note the group can hold runs whose parquet differs (a picker that answered twice), so this is
 * the newest run's encodings rather than the group's; the `dictionary` cell in `Cost and speed by
 * parquet layout` is where a group that disagrees with itself surfaces.
 *
 * `dict_pages < chunks` is flagged: a column the writer gave up dictionary-encoding partway through
 * still says `PLAIN_DICTIONARY` in its encoding list, so the list alone would read as "dictionary"
 * for a column that is mostly not.
 *
 * Renders NOTHING when no record carries `encodings`, which is every record written before
