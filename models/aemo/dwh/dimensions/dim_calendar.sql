-- One-off, fixed calendar dimension. Built in full on the first run; once the table
-- exists, every later run selects nothing (WHERE 1=0) so it's a no-op — dbt's idiom
-- for "create if not exists, otherwise skip". merge rather than append is uniformity
-- with the rest of the project rather than a fix: the source is empty on every
-- incremental run, so the statement matches nothing and costs nothing. The key is a
-- one-element LIST, not a scalar — a scalar routes through dbt's equals() macro,
-- the list form emits a plain `=` — and it is bracketed because `date` is reserved.
--
-- DuckDB's generate_series(...INTERVAL 1 DAY) has no T-SQL equivalent that survives
-- dbt-fabric's subquery wrapping (OPTION(MAXRECURSION) can't live in a derived table),
-- so build a 0..9999 tally by cross-joining digit tables and offset from the start date.
