{#-- Determinism contract (see the duckdb version for the full story): every run recomputes,
     with the SAME SQL as a full rebuild, exactly the dates whose stored content could be
     stale, and reconciles that batch key by key. Incremental == full-rebuild by construction
     for every date it touches; no cutoff watermark, no run-history dependence, no
     runner-decided branch.

     STRATEGY: `merge` on the full [date],[time],[DUID] grain — the SAME semantics as duckrun
     and spark (update matched + insert new). dbt-fabric's merge is default__get_merge_sql,
     which always emits WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET <every column> (merge_update_columns=[]
     is falsy and falls through to all columns), so a revised mw/price overwrites the stored
     row exactly as it does on the other two engines.
     It was `delete+insert` on [date] alone, which replaced whole dates and therefore RETRACTED
     rows the recomputation no longer produced. That made dwh the only engine whose row count
     could differ from the other three on identical inputs — see the note on dispatch_duids
     below for the bug it masked. Retraction is now gone here too: the repair lever for a row
     that should not exist is REBUILD_SUMMARY=1, not a silent per-date wipe.
     Bracket every key column: dbt interpolates them raw into the ON clause and `date`/`time`
     are T-SQL reserved words.

     We deliberately do NOT use --full-refresh on this engine: on dbt-fabric that DROPs +
     recreates the table (a Sch-M DDL swap that deadlocks Fabric's background stats
     maintenance, loses grants, and rebinds Direct Lake every run). The full-history
     rebuild lever is REBUILD_SUMMARY=1 / --vars 'rebuild_summary: true', which keeps the
     same delete+insert write path and just emits every date.

     The intraday branch is gated on dispatch_duids because the two branches read AEMO
     tables with DIFFERENT UNIT UNIVERSES: 26 non-scheduled units publish SCADA telemetry
     but have zero rows in fct_scada ever. The old delete+insert on [date] retracted them for
     free, which is why only the three merge engines went red — dwh was not more correct, just
     able to rewrite a whole date. Now that this engine merges too, that gate is the ONLY thing
     keeping those units out. See the duckdb version for the full story. --#}

{#-- cluster_by was REMOVED: on a CLUSTER BY table Fabric runs automatic background
     clustering/compaction that holds a lock on the table, and every fct_summary write then
     deadlocked against it *reproducibly* — the retry deadlocked too, same process id.
     Dropping cluster_by is what stops the deadlocks; the summary is small and date/DUID
     filtering is fine without physical clustering. Do not re-add it here. --#}
