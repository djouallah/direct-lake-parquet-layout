{#-- Intraday SCADA — reads the new scada_today files. The file set comes from the archive log
     (new_source_files) and is passed to OPENROWSET as an EXPLICIT BULK (...) list, not a folder
     glob (~288 small files land per day; globbing would re-read the whole archive each run). The
     list already excludes files in {{ this }}, but it is computed before the write, so merge on
     the natural key is the guard against two overlapping runs both inserting the same file. No
     INTERVENTION in the key: this feed has no such column. See the fct_price.sql header for why
     this merge cannot be insert-only on dbt-fabric. --#}
