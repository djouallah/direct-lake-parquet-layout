"""Provision Fabric items (idempotent: create if missing, keep if present) in $WS_ID and
print the env vars dbt/the notebook read to stdout (the workflow appends stdout to
$GITHUB_ENV). Diagnostics -> stderr.

Usage:
  python provision.py land                 # the ONE shared landing lakehouse (holds Files)
  python provision.py {duckrun|iceberg|dwh|spark}   # that engine's OUTPUT item
  python provision.py bench_prepare <engine>  # BOTH per-phase shortcut lakehouses for the bench job
  python provision.py bench_drop {dl|dq}   # delete one phase's semantic model + lakehouse, mid-run
  python provision.py teardown <record>    # DELETE every item that record names, except landing

The download happens once (in the `land` job) and every engine job provisions only its own output
item. The legs no longer share one FILES_PATH: each reads the SAME landed bytes through a
`Files/landing` shortcut in its own lakehouse (dwh through `dbt_dwh_src`, having no `Files` of its
own), so the read CU is attributed per engine instead of arriving as one undivided `dbt_landing`
row. See DWH_SRC. Naming is prefixed `dbt_` so it never clashes with the other AEMO repos sharing
this workspace.

**Every item this touches is written down under its GUID**, into the run-record fragment named by
`RUN_RECORD` (see record.py) — created, found, or deleted, with the timestamp. That is the input the
CU ledger joins on: a GUID belongs to exactly one run, so `cu/` no longer has to guess an item's
owner from its display name. `RUN_RECORD` unset is a no-op, so running this by hand still works.

`teardown` is the end of that story and the reason a GUID belongs to one run at all. It runs LAST,
takes the run's own merged record as its argument, and deletes **every item that record names**
except the two whose `role` is `landing` or `folder` — so it can only ever delete what this run
created, and it needs no list of names to do it. That is a real property: a name-driven teardown
would happily delete an item some other dispatch had just made, and there is no undo.

It deletes the whole ITEM, not tables inside it — a `Tables/<schema>/<name>` folder removed by
hand leaves the catalog entry behind and dbt then emits DML against nothing. `dbt_landing` is
excluded twice over, by role and by name, and `drop()` refuses it outright: that lakehouse holds the
downloaded AEMO archive, the one thing here that cannot be rebuilt from anything else in the
workspace. Both FOLDERS survive too — they hold no data and cost nothing.

Items live in TWO folders and the split is the point: `benchmark` holds everything a run creates and
the teardown deletes, `landing` holds the one lakehouse that outlives every run. A workspace listing
then shows at a glance what is disposable, and `benchmark` is empty between dispatches — which is
exactly the state a successful teardown leaves behind. `benchmark/deploy_models.py` puts its semantic
models in the same `benchmark` folder, so one name covers every item either half of the workflow
makes.

Costs, none of them errors: the dwh warehouse comes back with a new connectionString and no grants,
and every item comes back with a new GUID, so anything bound to the old one (a Direct Lake semantic
model, a shortcut) points at an item that no longer exists. `benchmark/` survives it because it
deploys its models per dispatch. And **every build is now a full load**, because nothing survives to
build on incrementally — which is what `reset_outputs` used to buy, minus the job that bought it.

The display-name reservation this used to fight is now on the other side of the run. `reset` deleted
immediately before the build, so Fabric was still holding the names when the legs tried to create
them (`409 ItemDisplayNameNotAvailableYet`, which killed three legs on run 30639018466). Deleting at
the END puts a whole idle period between the delete and the next dispatch's create, and `ensure()`'s
40x15s poll stays as the guard.

# Every leg reads the landed CSVs through a `Files/landing` SHORTCUT to dbt_landing sitting in its
# OWN lakehouse, and that is what splits the read CU: OneLake accounts a transaction against the
# REQUESTED PATH, so a read through a shortcut is booked to the item hosting the shortcut, not to
# the item holding the bytes. It is the only way the documented rule ("the transaction usage counts
# against the capacity tied to the workspace where the shortcut is created") can be implemented.
# Before this, all four legs read dbt_landing directly and `cu/` had one undivided 6,578.9 CU row
# it could not attribute to anyone.
#
# No new items for duckrun/iceberg/spark — the shortcut goes into the output lakehouse they already
# have, so a leg's landing reads land in the same `cu/` column as its writes. dwh is the ONE
# exception and not by preference: a Fabric Warehouse has no `Files` section and cannot host a
# shortcut at all, so it gets a lakehouse holding this shortcut and nothing else.
#
# THE NAME IS LOAD-BEARING, and `dbt_dwh_landing` is the wrong spelling. `cu/capacity_cu.py`'s
# `engine_of()` substring-matches a display name against CU_ENGINES **in order** — which starts
# `landing` — so `dbt_dwh_landing` would match `landing` first and put dwh's reads straight back
# into the column this change exists to empty. `_src` collides with no engine token. (That matcher
# is on its way out now that CU is attributed by GUID, but the name costs nothing to keep right.)
#
# It goes down with the teardown like everything else — it is recreated on the way in, holds no
# data, and an item that survives a run keeps drawing background CU into the next one's window.
# The `Files/landing` shortcut inside it goes with it, which is why the shortcut is ensured in each
# ENGINE's own mode rather than once in `land`: at `land` time the lakehouse that hosts it may not

    leg reads from — its own output lakehouse for duckrun/iceberg/spark, DWH_SRC for dwh.

    Verified against the live warehouse before this was written: parquet OPENROWSET, an explicit
    multi-file CSV `BULK (...)` list and the `*.CSV` + `filepath(1)` fallback all return byte-
    identical results through the shortcut and through the direct path. `[file]` is unaffected —
    `parse_filename` stores the stem, never the path, so no merge key moves.
