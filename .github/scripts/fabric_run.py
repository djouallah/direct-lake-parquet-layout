"""Ship this dbt project into a throwaway Fabric Python notebook and run `dbt run` there.

This is the only way the DuckDB-family engines build. There was once a second path — run
fabric_build.py directly on the GitHub runner when the fold looked small — chosen per run by a
pending-file count; it is gone, and with it the risk of guessing wrong. Here,
duckrun.run_python zips the project, uploads it to a temporary Fabric notebook,
pip-installs duckrun, and runs .github/scripts/fabric_build.py as a subprocess on Fabric compute —
data-local to OneLake, so a backlog drain never pulls the corpus across the public internet —
streaming the log back.

duckrun creates the notebook, runs it and deletes it; `ScriptResult.item_id` names it (duckrun
>= 0.4.38), which is the whole reason this file records anything. Fabric bills this leg's compute
against that item, so a GUID nobody wrote down is compute the CU ledger cannot attribute to an
engine. This used to be `keep_notebook=True` plus a list-the-workspace-and-match-the-display-name
resolve and a delete of our own — a reimplementation of duckrun's teardown, two extra control-plane
calls, and a silent miss whenever the name lookup failed. The id is reported whether or not the
notebook still exists, and a run that died before the payload ran carries it on the exception, so
both outcomes are attributable.

argv[1] is the engine (`duckrun` = Delta | `iceberg`). Its output lakehouse and the landing
Files path are provisioned on the runner first (provision.py) and forwarded as CONFIG env — never
tokens: the notebook self-acquires its OneLake token from the Fabric runtime. duckrun itself
self-acquires the Fabric control-plane + OneLake tokens on the runner via GitHub OIDC
(AZURE_CLIENT_ID / AZURE_TENANT_ID + id-token: write), so no token is minted here.
