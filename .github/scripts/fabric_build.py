"""Run `dbt build` for one DuckDB-family engine (argv[1]: `duckrun` = Delta | `iceberg`) against
the landed data, writing to that engine's OneLake lakehouse.

CI always runs this inside a throwaway Fabric Python notebook, as the entry script fabric_run.py
ships via duckrun.run_python — a fresh interpreter whose cwd is the unpacked project root, with
duckrun / dbt-duckdb already pip-installed. dbt.yml used to invoke it on the GitHub runner too for
folds a pending-file count called small; that path is gone.

Nothing below is location-specific, and it is worth keeping that way — it is what makes this
runnable by hand when you need to reproduce a CI failure. duckrun.auth resolves the OneLake token
from whatever is there (the Fabric runtime in a notebook, GitHub OIDC on a runner), so the token
is never shipped, and config (FILES_PATH, the output path, schema, limits) always arrives via env.

Tests run HERE, in the same invocation: `dbt build` interleaves model and test, so a broken model
stops the leg at the node that broke. There is no separate neutral-reader test job any more.
