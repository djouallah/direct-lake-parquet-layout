"""Offline tests for the warehouse V-Order read. No Fabric, no ODBC driver, no credentials.

WHY THIS IS WORTH PINNING. The value it records is the ONLY V-Order signal that can see a Fabric
Warehouse — the other two are Spark-shaped (a `TBLPROPERTIES` key and the Spark writer's per-file
`add.tags.VORDER`) and both read `false` for dwh against parquet that was V-Ordered throughout. So
this one number is what stops the page repeating that mistake, and every way it can go wrong is
silent:

- a `0` misread as "no answer" would turn a warehouse someone deliberately disabled into an absent
  key, and the page would fall back to the blind property and print V-Order anyway;
- a missing row misread as `False` would assert the opposite of the default on a run that could not
  be measured at all;
- a write into `layout.config` instead of `layout.ordering` would split dwh's dashboard column and its
  layout bar on a value that is measured rather than configured.

    failure would have been silent: no key in the record, and the page falling back to the blind

    only reason to exist here was mssql-python, and upstream took it over in 1.10.1.)
