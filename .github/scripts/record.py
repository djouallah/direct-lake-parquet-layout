"""One JSON document per dispatch — every stage merges into it, nothing is passed as text.

**The point of this file is the item GUID.** Before it, nothing recorded which Fabric items a run
created: `provision.py` resolved every GUID and wrote it to stderr, `stats.py` resolved all four and
dropped them on the floor, and the notebook's was never seen on the runner at all. CU could then only
be attributed by matching item DISPLAY NAMES, which is why `cu/` had an `engine_of()` substring
matcher, a lagging `'Items'` snapshot join, and a `shared` column for everything it could not name.

A run now writes down every GUID it touched. Combined with the teardown — every item except
`dbt_landing` is deleted when the run finishes — a GUID belongs to exactly one run, and attributing
CU becomes a dictionary lookup instead of a heuristic.

Env in: `RUN_RECORD` (path to the fragment this stage writes). **Unset is a no-op**, deliberately:
`provision.py` and `stats.py` must stay runnable by hand to reproduce a CI failure, and neither
should need a record path to do it.

Each stage writes its OWN fragment file — separate jobs run on separate runners and cannot share one
— and a final job merges them by basename order, exactly as `benchmark/merge_reports.py` already does
for the benchmark's fragments. That is also why `items` is a dict keyed by GUID rather than a list:
a deep merge unions dicts and REPLACES lists, so the teardown fragment's `{guid: {deleted: ...}}`
lands on top of the provision fragment's `{guid: {created: ...}}` without either knowing about the
other.

This is a 20-line copy of `benchmark/report.py`'s helper rather than an import of it. `.github/scripts/`
and `benchmark/` cannot import each other without a sys.path hack, and `benchmark/` being deletable by
removing one directory is a property worth more than twenty lines.

    A record moved by hand without re-running this leaves the index stale; the loader drops a name it
