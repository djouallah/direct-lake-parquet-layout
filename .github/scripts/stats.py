"""Table layout + row-count parity: duckrun.get_stats() over EVERY engine's output, pivoted to
$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY. Run by the `layout` job of .github/workflows/dbt.yml.

The project's thesis is: same raw data -> four engines (duckrun/Delta, iceberg, Fabric Warehouse,
Spark) -> identical output. So the final row counts should line up column-for-column. get_stats reads
each item's Delta log, and OneLake surfaces every item (including the native Iceberg lakehouse and the
Warehouse) with a Delta representation, so ONE reader covers all four. Diagnostics -> stderr.

**`STATS_JSON` makes this run's result reusable, and that matters because this is EXPENSIVE and
NEARLY STATIC.** Reading four Delta logs over OneLake takes ~10 minutes (the iceberg item alone 12m+),
while files/row groups/size/v-order only move when the tables are rewritten — which is why this is a
dispatch-only workflow rather than a job in every build. A step summary could not be reused: the
markdown goes to stdout and into `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`, readable by a human on the run page and by
NOTHING else — not in the job log (stdout is redirected), and GitHub exposes no REST endpoint for it.
Set `STATS_JSON=<path>` and the same numbers are also written as JSON, which the workflow uploads as
the `stats` artifact; `cu/` downloads it from this workflow's latest successful run so a CU report can
sit next to the layout that produced it, WITHOUT a second reader of the same Delta logs and without
duckrun or a storage token anywhere near `cu/`. A cached reading is sound precisely because the layout
is near-static.

The same document is also merged into the RUN RECORD under `layout` (see record.py) — two sinks, one
document. The artifact is how a run's layout is read back without a checkout; the record is what
outlives artifact retention and what the page joins against the CU ledger. `engines[e].guid` is the
join key, and it was resolved here and discarded one line later until this was written.

It also reports the INPUT side — `landing`: how many files and how many bytes sit in the archive
every engine reads. Everything else here describes what came out; without that, the record can say a
run wrote 143,980,961 rows and not say from how much. It is read by listing the store rather than
querying it, because DuckDB's `glob()` returns paths and no sizes and the archive is uncompressed
CSV whose bytes are the point.

It also reports whether the writer PHYSICALLY REORDERED THE ROWS — `ordering`, see `ordering_for`.
V-Order is documented as a row-reordering pass and nothing here could tell whether it happened: the
`vorder` detail key is a table PROPERTY nobody sets, so it reads false for spark whatever the files
contain. That is measured from the parquet itself now, plus the per-file Delta `VORDER` tag this
file's own comments have called the honest check for months without anything reading it.

**NEITHER of those two sees a WAREHOUSE, and reading them as "dwh writes no V-Order" is wrong.** The
property is a `TBLPROPERTIES` key and the tag is a Spark-writer marker; the warehouse engine sets
neither and V-Orders **by default** on every new warehouse (irreversible once disabled). So
`ordering_for` skips the tag read for `kind == "warehouses"` — absent, not `tagged: 0` — and dwh's
answer comes from `sys.databases.is_vorder_enabled`, recorded by the dwh leg as
`layout.ordering.dwh.vorder_enabled`.

That JSON is a data contract with a consumer outside this file. Its shape is
`{"run": {...}, "config": {...}, "engines": {...}, "tables": [...], "landing": {...},
"ordering": {engine: {...}}, "stats": {engine: {table: {detail}}}}` and the detail keys are
DETAIL_KEYS below. `config` is what the build ran ON — vCores,
Spark resource profile, native execution engine — read from the env the legs were actually given, so
the page can state the hardware instead of asserting it. Adding a key is safe; renaming or removing one breaks `cu/`'s layout
table, which degrades to a note rather than an error — so a rename fails QUIETLY over there. Change
both together.

    Pure: it aggregates the rows `mart_chunks` fetched and reads nothing itself.

    The table `mart_chunks` was given MUST BE SCHEMA-QUALIFIED (`mart.fct_summary`). A bare name does
    not resolve — `get_stats()` with no argument sweeps every attached catalog and keys the result by
    table name, but `get_stats('fct_summary')` raises `'fct_summary' is neither a known table nor a
    schema in any attached catalog (['data'])`, because a one-part name is looked up in the CURRENT
    schema and dbt writes the mart to `mart`. That is what run 31008858454 hit: the layout job was
    green, the record simply had no `encodings`. `one_engine` passes the schema `stats_for` already
    read, so the name cannot drift from the one the rest of the document reports.

    WHY THIS EXISTS. Every other lever on the layout chart is confounded, and the one hypothesis the
    record could not test was the interesting one: whether the engines differ in what Power BI has to
    transcode, i.e. PER-COLUMN PARQUET ENCODING. `compression` was captured (SNAPPY everywhere except
    dwh, which is UNCOMPRESSED) and encoding was not, so a 2.6x gap between spark's two resource
    profiles at the same row-group band had no measurable explanation. Bytes-per-row rules out size
    as the cause — duckrun writes the DENSEST parquet on the page (5.63 B/row) and does not win, and
    the smallest of all (4.74, the date,time,DUID sort) has that engine's worst CU.

    No pyarrow: `get_stats(detailed=True)` returns DuckDB's raw `parquet_metadata()`, one row per
    column chunk, carrying `encodings`, `type`, `dictionary_page_offset` and the compressed size. The
    footers are already being read for the aggregate call, so the marginal cost is one more read of
    the same files.

    SCOPED TO THE MART, and that is a cost decision rather than a preference. The layout job already
    runs ~10 minutes (the iceberg item alone reads at 12m+ over OneLake), a full pass would be one
    chunk row per column per row group across all eight tables — iceberg's 1,172 row groups times
    `fct_price`'s ~130 columns is six figures of rows for a question nobody asked — and `fct_summary`
    is the only table the query benchmark touches, the only one the layout chart is about, and the
    only one at row-count parity by construction.

    Aggregated to one row per COLUMN, never per chunk: the distinct encodings across every chunk
    (sorted, so two engines are string-comparable), whether a dictionary page was written, and the
    compressed megabytes. That is what answers "same encoding or not" and it stays a handful of keys.

    Best-effort, like `landing_stats`: any failure returns `{}` and the record simply has no
    `encodings`. An absent key reads as "not measured"; `{}` per column would read as "no encodings",

    For each column: one `[min, max]` range per row group, sorted by min, then the percentage of
    CONSECUTIVE PAIRS that overlap. 0% means the row groups partition the column's range — every
    value lives in essentially one row group, which is what a global sort (or any real clustering
    pass) produces and what lets Direct Lake and every predicate pushdown skip segments. ~100% means
    every row group spans the whole domain, i.e. the rows arrived in no order at all.

    THE COMPARISON IS STRICT (`min_i < max_{i-1}`) AND THAT IS NOT A ROUNDING CHOICE. A row group
    boundary almost never lands on a value boundary, so under a PERFECT sort the last row of one row
    group and the first row of the next hold the SAME value — `min_i == max_{i-1}` — and a
    touch-counts-as-overlap rule scores a flawlessly sorted column 100%. Measured on synthetic
    fct_summary-shaped data before this was strict: `date` sorted, one value straddling each
    boundary, read 100% overlap on every column of every case, i.e. the metric saturated and said
    nothing. Strict counts only ranges that genuinely INTERLEAVE, which is the property being asked
    about; the cost is that a column whose every row group holds one single value cannot be
    distinguished from a sorted one, which is true and uninteresting.

    Sorted by min rather than left in file order on purpose: file order is an artifact of the writer
    and would make a descending sort look as unclustered as a shuffle. Sorting first asks "COULD
    these ranges be laid out disjointly", which is the property that matters and is direction-blind.

    Free: it reads the rows `mart_chunks` already fetched, so it costs no OneLake traffic at all.

    WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, and why `run_lengths` exists beside it: this is a statement about ordering
    ACROSS row groups. A writer that assigns rows to row groups by range and then shuffles within
    each one scores 0% here and is not sorted in any sense Power BI benefits from.

    THIS IS THE QUESTION `rg_ordering` CANNOT ANSWER: whether the writer reordered rows INSIDE a row
    group. V-Order is documented as a row-reordering pass, and nothing in this repo could tell
    whether it does anything — the `vorder` detail column is a table property nobody sets. A run is a
    maximal span of equal adjacent values, so `runs` ≈ `rows` means the column's values are
    interleaved (nothing reordered them) and `runs` ≪ `rows` means equal values were brought
    together, which is exactly what makes RLE and dictionary encoding pay and what Power BI
    transcodes cheaply.

    Read it as a RATIO of the rows sampled, never as an absolute: a near-unique column (`mw`,
    `price`) is the built-in control — it CANNOT score low unless the file really was reordered, so a
    run where every column drops together is measuring something real rather than low cardinality.

    ONE FILE, `ORDERING_SAMPLE_ROWS` rows of it — the largest live file, ties broken by name so two
    dispatches of the same layout sample the same place. The whole mart is 143M rows across up to 80
    files and this job already runs 10-15 minutes; the ordering of one file's first 4M rows answers
    the question, and a full pass would answer it four times over on paid capacity.

    ORDERED BY `file_row_number` EXPLICITLY. That is the physical row index within the file, so the
    count does not depend on DuckDB's scan order, its thread count, or `preserve_insertion_order` —
    the one way this measurement could have been silently wrong.

    """`{tagged, files, unknown}` — how many LIVE parquet files carry Fabric's `VORDER` add tag.

    THE CHECK THIS FILE'S OWN COMMENTS HAVE CALLED THE HONEST ONE and nothing implemented. The
    `vorder` detail column comes from duckrun's `get_stats`, which reads the TABLE PROPERTY
    `delta.parquet.vorder.enabled` off the Delta metadata — nothing in this repo or in Fabric's
    writer sets that property, so it reads false for spark no matter what the files contain. Spark
    records V-Order per file, as an `add.tags` entry, and delta-rs's `get_add_actions` does not
    surface tags, which is why this reads the commit JSON itself.

    Pure, so the parsing is testable without a store. Last `add` per path wins (a file re-added by a
    later commit is described by that commit) and REMOVES ARE NOT REPLAYED — the live set comes from
    the file list `mart_chunks` already read, which duckrun derived from the Delta log with
    tombstones excluded. That is the simplification that makes this cheap AND keeps it from
    disagreeing with the rest of the document about which files exist.

    Matched on BASENAME: `file_name` is a full abfss URI and `add.path` is table-relative and
    URL-encoded. The names are GUID-bearing, so basename equality is unambiguous.

    `unknown` counts live files no JSON commit describes — their add was folded into a checkpoint.
    Reported rather than guessed at, and structurally rare here: the teardown means every dispatch
    builds its tables from nothing, so the log is a handful of commits.

    different. The three answer different halves and none of them subsumes another:

    - `columns[c].rg_overlap_pct` — ordering ACROSS row groups, free from metadata already fetched.
    - `columns[c].runs` — ordering WITHIN a file, from a bounded read of one sample file. This is
      the intra-file reordering V-Order claims and nothing else here can see.
    - `vorder_files` — whether Fabric TAGGED the files as V-Ordered, read from the Delta log. A
      measured answer to the question the `vorder` detail column pretends to answer — **for a
      Spark-written table only**. `kind == "warehouses"` skips it, because the tag is a Spark-writer
      marker and the warehouse writes none: it read `0/77` against dwh's own V-Ordered parquet, which

    its layout bar on a difference in what was MEASURED rather than what was configured.
