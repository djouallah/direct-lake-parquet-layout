"""Is V-Order on for this run's warehouse? One row from `sys.databases`, into the run record.

WHY THIS EXISTS, because the obvious answer is that the layout job already reports V-Order and it
does not — not for a Warehouse. The two signals `stats.py` carries are both SPARK-shaped:

- `stats[dwh][*].vorder` is the Delta table property `delta.parquet.vorder.enabled`, read by
  duckrun's `get_stats`. It is a `TBLPROPERTIES` key. Fabric's warehouse writer does not set it.
- `ordering.dwh.vorder_files` was the per-file Delta `add.tags.VORDER` marker, which the Fabric SPARK
  writer stamps and the warehouse writer does not.

So both read "no V-Order" for dwh, and both were WRONG: the warehouse V-Orders **by default** on
every new warehouse. Measured against runs 31148571096 and 31167379761 — freshly created warehouses,
0 of 77 and 0 of 78 `mart.fct_summary` files tagged, `unknown: 0`, i.e. a completely successful read
of a log that simply does not carry the marker. Indistinguishable, on the page, from a writer that
did not V-Order. That is the false negative this script closes; `ordering_for` now skips the tag read
for a warehouse so the absence is honest, and this supplies the answer that probe cannot see.

`sys.databases.is_vorder_enabled` is the ONLY authoritative source — it is what Microsoft's own
`disable-v-order` doc tells you to query, `1` enabled and `0` disabled. Nothing in this repo runs the
`ALTER DATABASE CURRENT SET VORDER = OFF` that would flip it (and that is irreversible, so it could
never be flipped back), which means the expected reading here is `True` on every run. Recording it
anyway rather than hardcoding the default: it costs one round trip on a leg that is already connected,
and a value read is a value that would NOTICE if the default ever changed or if someone disabled it
by hand. The whole reason this file was needed is that this repo asserted a V-Order default from
documentation for months and had it backwards.

Runs on the dwh leg, after the build, on the runner that is already the dbt client — so the driver and
the `database.windows.net` token are both in place. **`mssql_python`, NOT `pyodbc`:** the pin is
`dbt-fabric==1.11.0`, Microsoft's own adapter, whose dependency is `mssql-python` (which bundles its
own driver, hence no `DRIVER=` in the connection string and nothing to discover). pyodbc is not
installed on that leg at all — and the runner image carries no ODBC driver either — so the first
version of this file would have failed on every run, silently, because the step is best-effort. Do
not "simplify" it back to pyodbc. This held under `dbt-fabric-samdebruyn` for the same reason: that
fork existed here only because it had moved to mssql-python before upstream did, and upstream did in
1.10.1. **Best-effort and never fatal:** a
failure leaves the key ABSENT, never `false`, because `false` here is a claim (V-Order was disabled)
and absence is the truth (nobody could ask). It writes into the leg's own record fragment, whose
`layout.ordering.dwh` deep-merges with `stats.py`'s — `record.deep_update` unions dicts, and the
fragments merge in basename order (`-20-build` before `-30-layout`), so both survive.

It must NOT land in `layout.config`: the dashboard's `variant()` walks every key of that block into a
column name, so a measured value there would split dwh's column and its layout bar whenever it moved.
`layout.ordering` is the correct sibling — the same rule `ordering_for` documents.

**IT ALSO SETS, WITH `--off`, AND THAT HALF IS FATAL — the asymmetry is deliberate.** `dwh_vorder`
is a dispatch input now, so a run can ask for an un-V-Ordered warehouse and be compared against a
V-Ordered one; `--off` issues `ALTER DATABASE CURRENT SET VORDER = OFF` and runs BEFORE the build,
because V-Order only affects files written after it and there is no retrofit short of a rewrite.
Reading is best-effort because a missing measurement is honest — nobody could ask. SETTING cannot be:
a silent failure would leave the leg writing V-Ordered parquet while the record, the dashboard column
and the caption all said it did not, which is the one shape of wrong this repo keeps paying for. So
`--off` verifies the flag actually moved, on the same connection, and exits non-zero if it did not.
It lives here rather than in a second script because this file already owns the only T-SQL connection
in the repo, and two spellings of `connect()` would be two things to keep in step with the adapter.

⚠️ The `ALTER` is **IRREVERSIBLE for that database** — Microsoft documents no way back. It is safe
here for one reason and it is worth stating rather than rediscovering: the teardown DELETES the
warehouse at the end of every run and the next dispatch creates a new one, V-Ordered by default. The
irreversibility is scoped to an item that lives a single run. Do not lift this onto a warehouse that
outlives its dispatch.

Env in: `FABRIC_DWH_SERVER`, `FABRIC_DWH_NAME`, `FABRIC_ACCESS_TOKEN` (all set by `provision.py` and
the token step), `RUN_RECORD`. **`RUN_RECORD` unset is a no-op**, so this stays runnable by hand to
reproduce a CI reading. Diagnostics -> stderr.
