"""Offline tests for the recorded sort key. No Fabric, no network, no credentials.

WHAT THIS PINS IS A SILENT GAP. The dashboard captions a sorted bar with the columns the run
ordered by, and the key is a property of the COMMIT — the model declared `['date','time','DUID']`
for a while and `['date','time']` since. A constant in the render layer was right for today's model
only, and captioned run 30955591822, a DUID sort, `by date, time`. Nothing errored; the page just
said something untrue.

So the run has to write its own key down, and every way that can quietly stop happening is here:
the model path resolving off the CWD, the regex missing a respelt config, `'auto'` being recorded as
if it named columns, and the merge landing under `layout` where the page does not read it.
